## Terminologies
- **Stack**: A linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Element**: The data item stored in the stack.
- **Top Pointer**: Indicates the current top element of the stack.
- **Size**: The number of elements currently in the stack.

## Structure of a Stack
A stack can be implemented using:
- **Array**: A fixed-size structure where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked List**: A dynamic structure where each element points to the next, allowing for flexible size.

## Variants of Stacks
- **Single Stack**: A basic stack with standard operations.
- **Double Stack**: Two stacks sharing the same memory space, often used in specific applications.
- **Min Stack**: A stack that keeps track of the minimum element in constant time.

## Features
- **LIFO Order**: The last element added is the first to be removed.
- **Dynamic Size**: Can grow and shrink as elements are added or removed.
- **Memory Management**: Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

## Comparison with Other Data Structures
- **Queue**: Follows First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, unlike the LIFO of stacks.
- **Array**: Fixed size and allows random access, while stacks have dynamic size and sequential access.
- **Linked List**: Can be used to implement stacks, but stacks have specific operations that make them simpler for certain tasks.

## Use Cases of Stacks
- Function call management (call stack)
- Undo mechanisms in applications
- Syntax parsing (e.g., in compilers)
- Backtracking algorithms (e.g., maze solving)

## Summary of Stacks
Stacks are fundamental data structures that provide efficient ways to manage data in a LIFO manner. They are widely used in various applications, including function management, parsing, and algorithm design.
