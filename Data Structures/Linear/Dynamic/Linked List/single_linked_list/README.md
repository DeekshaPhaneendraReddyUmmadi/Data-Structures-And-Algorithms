# Single Linked Document

## Overview

A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element (or node) contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. This document outlines the key features of a singly linked list.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Size**
   - Singly linked lists can grow and shrink in size dynamically as elements are added or removed, allowing for efficient memory usage compared to static data structures like arrays.

2. **Node Structure**
   - Each node in a singly linked list contains two components:
     - **Data**: The value or information stored in the node.
     - **Next Pointer**: A reference to the next node in the list. The last node's next pointer points to `null` (or `None` in Python), indicating the end of the list.

3. **Sequential Access**
   - Elements are accessed sequentially, starting from the head (the first node). To access a specific element, you may need to traverse the list from the beginning.

4. **Insertion and Deletion**
   - Insertion and deletion operations can be performed efficiently, especially at the beginning of the list:
     - **Insertion at the head**: O(1) time complexity.
     - **Insertion at the tail**: O(n) time complexity (unless a tail pointer is maintained).
     - **Deletion**: O(n) time complexity (to find the node to delete).

5. **No Contiguous Memory Allocation**
   - Nodes are not stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient use of memory.

6. **Single Direction**
   - The list is traversed in a single direction (from head to tail), which differentiates it from doubly linked lists.

7. **Memory Overhead**
   - Each node requires additional memory for the pointer/reference to the next node, which can lead to higher memory usage compared to arrays, especially for small data sizes.

8. **Reversibility**
   - A singly linked list can be reversed, but this requires additional operations and is not as straightforward as in a doubly linked list.

9. **Implementation of Other Data Structures**
   - Singly linked lists can be used to implement other data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables.

10. **No Random Access**
    - Unlike arrays, singly linked lists do not support random access to elements. To access an element at a specific index, you must traverse the list from the head.

## Getting Started

To get started with the single linked document, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone



## Conclusion

Singly linked lists are a versatile and widely used data structure, particularly useful in scenarios where dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions are required. However, they come with trade-offs, such as the lack of random access and additional memory overhead for pointers.
