## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of various data structures and algorithms. It is designed to help students, developers, and enthusiasts understand the fundamental concepts and implementations of DSA.
## Note :
- I am using the Java programming language for this documentation.

## Getting Started
To get started with this document, you can clone the repository and open the files in your preferred text editor or IDE.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DeekshaPhaneendraReddyUmmadi/Data-Structures-And-Algorithms
    cd Data-Structures-And-Algorithms

## Data Structures
      
  ### Arrays
  An array is a collection of elements identified by index or key. It allows for efficient access and manipulation of data. Arrays are fixed in size and store elements of the same type.

  - **Characteristics**: Fixed size, homogeneous elements, contiguous memory allocation.
  - **Operations**: Access, Insertion, Deletion, Traversal.

  ### Linked Lists
  A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

  - **Types**:
    - **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node.
    - **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.
    - **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node.

  ### Stacks
  A stack is a collection of elements that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be added or removed only from the top of the stack.

  - **Operations**: 
    - **Push**: Add an element to the top.
    - **Pop**: Remove the top element.
    - **Peek**: View the top element without removing it.

  ### Queues
  A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the back and removed from the front.

  - **Types**:
    - **Simple Queue**: Basic FIFO structure.
    - **Circular Queue**: The last position is connected back to the first position.
    - **Priority Queue**: Elements are removed based on priority rather than order of insertion.

  ### Trees
  A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single root node and sub-nodes (children). Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships.

  - **Types**:
    - **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
    - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent and the right child is greater.
    - **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree.
    - **Red-Black Tree**: A balanced binary search tree with specific properties to ensure balance.

  ### Graphs
  A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can represent various relationships and are used in many applications, such as social networks and transportation systems.

  - **Representations**:
    - **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where each cell indicates whether pairs of vertices are adjacent.
    - **Adjacency List**: A list where each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices.
